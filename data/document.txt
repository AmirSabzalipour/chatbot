Alongside my postdoctoral responsibilities, I serve as Training Programme Lead for a flagship skills programme designed and delivered by the Gitahead Training Group (Ali Farnudi, Sergey Senkin, Damien Georges, and Elham Ghobadpour). This programme provides structured, hands-on training in collaborative scientific coding, research software development, and best practices for open and reproducible science.
The programme consists of six fully interactive, half-day workshops, progressing from beginner to advanced level. It equips researchers with practical skills for writing robust, maintainable, and scalable scientific software, with a strong emphasis on teamwork, real-world workflows, and reproducibility.
Key areas covered include:
Version control and collaborative workflows using Git
Writing clean, readable, and well-documented code
Debugging, testing, and code quality assurance
Virtual environments and dependency management
Modular programming and software design principles
Open-source licensing and research software sustainability
Software package development and distribution
Performance optimisation, parallel computing, and data pipelines
The workshops are delivered as:
Git Started
Code Champions: Virtual Environments for Real People
Branching into the Multiverse: Git’s Hidden Powers
Debugging Dragons: Conquering Bugs and Writing Clean Code
Packaging Paladins: Crafting and Documenting Your Code
Fast and Furious: Speeding Up Your Code
In this role, I lead curriculum design, coordinate team-based delivery, and ensure the training remains inclusive, practical, and aligned with the evolving needs of modern, collaborative research environments.

Designed and delivered an introductory course on "Supervised Statistical Learning" for Business and Informatics majors. The course was structured with a balanced pedagogy, combining 50% lectures and 50% hands-on practical sessions, in which students implemented core concepts in Python. Content covered fundamental machine learning methods with an emphasis on regression-based modelling, including linear, polynomial, logistic, and multiple regression; variable selection techniques (forward and backward selection); regularisation approaches such as ridge regression and LASSO; and statistical hypothesis testing for model evaluation and interpretation. The curriculum bridged statistical theory with applied, business-relevant use cases.
