Cinderella

Once upon a time, there lived a kind and beautiful young girl whose mother had died when she was very young. Her father remarried, hoping to give his daughter a loving family, but soon after, he too passed away, leaving the girl in the care of her stepmother and two stepsisters.

The stepmother was cruel and jealous of the girl's beauty and gentle nature. She forced her to do all the household work—scrubbing floors, washing dishes, cooking meals, and tending the fire. The girl's fine clothes were taken away, and she was given nothing but rags to wear. She slept by the fireplace among the cinders and ashes, and so her stepsisters mockingly called her "Cinderella."

Despite her hardships, Cinderella remained kind and hopeful, finding friendship in the mice and birds that visited her.

One day, an invitation arrived from the royal palace. The King was throwing a grand ball so that the Prince could meet all the young ladies in the kingdom and choose a bride. The stepsisters were thrilled and immediately began preparing their finest gowns. Cinderella asked if she too could attend, but her stepmother laughed cruelly and gave her an impossible task: she could go only if she finished all her chores and found something suitable to wear.

Cinderella worked as hard as she could, but her stepmother kept adding more tasks. When the carriage finally arrived, her stepsisters tore apart the dress Cinderella had managed to mend, and they left for the ball, laughing at her tears.

Alone and heartbroken, Cinderella wept in the garden. Suddenly, a shimmering light appeared, and her Fairy Godmother stood before her. "Dry your tears, my dear," she said warmly. "You shall go to the ball!"

With a wave of her wand, the Fairy Godmother transformed a pumpkin into a magnificent golden coach, mice into prancing horses, a rat into a coachman, and lizards into footmen. Then she touched Cinderella's rags, and they became a breathtaking gown of silver and gold, complete with delicate glass slippers.

"Remember," the Fairy Godmother warned, "the magic will end at midnight. You must leave before the clock strikes twelve."

Cinderella arrived at the palace, and everyone was captivated by her beauty and grace. The Prince danced with her all evening, enchanted by her kindness and her sparkling eyes. Cinderella was so happy that she forgot about the time—until she heard the clock begin to strike midnight.

She fled from the ballroom and rushed down the palace steps, but in her haste, one of her glass slippers fell off. She had no time to retrieve it. As the clock struck twelve, her gown turned back to rags, the coach became a pumpkin, and she ran home with only one glass slipper remaining.

The Prince, desperate to find the mysterious girl he had fallen in love with, declared that he would marry the maiden whose foot fit the glass slipper. His servants traveled throughout the kingdom, asking every young woman to try it on.

When they arrived at Cinderella's home, the stepsisters tried to squeeze their feet into the slipper, but it was far too small. Just as the servants were about to leave, Cinderella stepped forward and asked if she might try.

Her stepmother protested, but the servants insisted. Cinderella sat down, and the slipper fit perfectly. Then, to everyone's amazement, she pulled the matching slipper from her pocket.

At that moment, the Fairy Godmother appeared and transformed Cinderella's rags back into a beautiful gown. The Prince recognized her immediately, and Cinderella forgave her stepfamily for their cruelty.

Cinderella and the Prince were married in a grand ceremony, and they lived happily ever after. And Cinderella, who had remained kind even in the darkest times, found that goodness and hope had brought her the happiness she deserved.
