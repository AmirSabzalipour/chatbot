PROJECTS

DESIGN OF INTERIOR PERMANNET MAGNET (IPM) MOTOR FOR EV VEHICLES
NOV 2024 - FEB 2024
github.com/ArameshAli/IPM- Motor technology
In this project we are designing interior Permanent Magnet (IPM) technology for EVs. IPM motors offer superior power density and efficiency, delivering higher torque across a broad speed range. By enhancing reluctance torque, they achieve increased performance at high speeds, making them ideal for EV applications.
Tools: ANSYS Motor-CAD

VIBROACOUSTIC COMFORT IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES
APRIL 2019 - JUNE 2019
github.com/ArameshAli/Half-Vehicle-Model/blob/main/HalfVM.m - Half Vehicle model
The half vehicle modal is the most popular method of analysing comfort and perform mathematical modelling of a vehicle. Objectives are: 1. Obtain engine modal excitation data from Ansys. 2. To determine the transmissibility function of the HVM. 3. Validate obtained/observed acceleration function from the modal with real Twizy experimental values.
Tools: Ansys, simulink

SUSTAINABLE VEHICLE POWERTRAINS
JAN 2019 - MARCH 2019

The aim of this project is to characterise the performance of commercial Lithium ion automotive battery cells and use experimental data to create the design specification for a battery electric vehicle.

POWERTRAIN CALIBRATION OPTIMISATION
JAN 2019 - MARCH 2019
github.com/ArameshAli/NOx-modeling/blob/main/Project1.m - NOx simulation
We will reduce NOx emissions in this project. The goal is to reduce NOx while increasing particulate matter (PM), which is unavoidable. There is a tradeoff between NOx and PM. While NOx levels have decreased, PM levels have increased.
Techniques: mixed-integer linear programming, quadratic programming, nonlinear optimisation

SUSTAINABLE VEHICLE POWERTRAIN
JAN 2019 - MARCH 2019
github.com/ArameshAli/NOx-modeling/blob/main/Project1.m - Hybrid Vehicle Modelling & Analysis
In the future, cars will be characterised by an increasing degree of hybridisation. They use increasing levels of hybridisation, and the expectation is that this improves the fuel economy. The purpose of this project is to look at the impact of vehicle architectures, to understand how and why fuel economy can be improved, and at finding the right control strategy for a hybrid powertrain.
